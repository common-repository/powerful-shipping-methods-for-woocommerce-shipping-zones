Quickly create flexible shipping costs using rules with conditions depending on volume, weight, dimensional weight, quantity and order total.
 
== Description ==

Create shipping costs effortlessly with simple rules.

Rules can add costs and conditions depending on volume, weight, dimensional weight, quantity and order total.

Each variable in a rule has a minimum and maximum values as conditions.
 
If the rule conditions are satisfied, the shipping costs are applied (which can be a fixed cost or cost per volume, cost per weight etc). 

If more than one rule matches an order, the rule with the least cost will be applied. If no rules match the order, shipping for that shipping method will be unavailable.

You can add more than one Powerful Shipping Method to a shipping zone.
